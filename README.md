### Hi there :raising_hand:

## Introduction
My name is Billy Franko, currently a 8th semester student in Multi Data Palembang University studying Informatics. Other than that, I'm an alumni of the Bangkit 2023 Batch 2 Mobile Development Learning Path. My projects were made using Kotlin/Java for Android dan PHP for Website Apps. As an example, one of my project is CarVal, a final project made during Bangkit 2023 Batch 2 to detect false job applications. Please take a look at it!
